- Here, I'm currently working in a scrum/agile team named sManager’s E-COM
to develop Sheba’s e-Commerce websites with NextJs and Redux.

I have proven ability to leverage front-end knowledge and experience to
build interactive and user-centered websites designs to scale and have extensive expertise in large system architecture development like
Shopify and its theme development.

Moreover, I'm maintaining Jira and Bitbucket very well to track all the work
progresses and tasks given on each sprint after analyzing and planning for the projects.
